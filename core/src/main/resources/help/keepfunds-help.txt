NAME
----
keepfunds - keep BTC received during a trade in Bisq wallet

SYNOPSIS
--------
keepfunds
		--trade-id=<trade-id>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A BTC buyer completes the final step in the trade protocol by keeping received BTC in his
Bisq wallet.  This step may not seem necessary from the buyer's perspective, but it is
necessary for correct transition of a trade's state to CLOSED, within the Bisq server.

The alternative way to close out the trade is to send the received BTC to an external
BTC wallet, using the withdrawfunds command.

OPTIONS
-------
--trade-id
		The ID of the trade (the full offer-id).

EXAMPLES
--------
A BTC seller has informed the buyer that fiat payment has been received for trade with ID
83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea, and locked BTC has been released to the buyer.
The BTC buyer closes out the trade by keeping the received BTC in her Bisq wallet:
$ ./bisq-cli --password=xyz --port=9998 keepfunds -trade-id=83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea
